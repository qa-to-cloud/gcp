## 2. Cloud Computing Data Dictionary

This dictionary defines common terms and concepts in cloud computing, essential for understanding cloud environments, including Google Cloud Platform.

* **Cloud Computing:**
    * **Definition:** The on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. It offers greater flexibility, scalability, and reliability than traditional on-premises infrastructure.

* **Cloud Deployment Models:**
    * **Public Cloud:**
        * **Definition:** Cloud services are delivered over the public internet and hosted on the cloud provider's infrastructure. Resources are shared among multiple tenants.
        * **Example (GCP):** Google Cloud Platform itself.
    * **Private Cloud:**
        * **Definition:** Dedicated cloud infrastructure for a single organization, either hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider. Offers greater control and security.
    * **Hybrid Cloud:**
        * **Definition:** A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This model provides a balance of flexibility, scalability, and control.
    * **Multi-cloud:**
        * **Definition:** The use of multiple public cloud providers to meet different business needs or to avoid vendor lock-in.

* **Cloud Service Models:**
    * **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):**
        * **Definition:** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including virtual machines, storage, networks, and operating systems. You manage the operating systems, applications, and data.
        * **Your Responsibility:** OS, middleware, applications, data, runtime.
        * **Provider Responsibility:** Virtualization, servers, storage, networking, physical data centers.
        * **Example (GCP):** Compute Engine.
    * **PaaS (Platform as a Service):**
        * **Definition:** Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. You manage your application code and data.
        * **Your Responsibility:** Applications, data.
        * **Provider Responsibility:** OS, middleware, runtime, servers, storage, networking, physical data centers.
        * **Example (GCP):** App Engine, Cloud Run.
    * **SaaS (Software as a Service):**
        * **Definition:** Delivers software applications over the internet, typically on a subscription basis. The provider manages the entire application stack. You simply use the software.
        * **Your Responsibility:** User access, basic configuration (if allowed by the application).
        * **Provider Responsibility:** Everything (application, data, runtime, OS, middleware, servers, storage, networking, physical data centers).
        * **Example (GCP-related):** Gmail, Google Workspace.

* **Key Cloud Concepts:**
    * **Scalability:**
        * **Definition:** The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources (e.g., more servers, more storage).
    * **Elasticity:**
        * **Definition:** The ability of a system to automatically scale resources up or down rapidly to meet immediate demand, and then scale back down when no longer needed.
    * **Serverless Computing:**
        * **Definition:** A cloud execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. You only pay for the exact amount of resources consumed by your code, and the underlying infrastructure is abstracted away.
        * **Example (GCP):** Cloud Functions, Cloud Run.
    * **Shared Responsibility Model:**
        * **Definition:** A security framework that clarifies the security responsibilities between the cloud provider and the cloud customer. The provider is responsible for the "security *of* the cloud" (e.g., physical infrastructure, network, hypervisor), while the customer is responsible for "security *in* the cloud" (e.g., data, applications, configurations, identity and access management).
    * **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):**
        * **Definition:** A financial estimate intended to help consumers and business owners determine the direct and indirect costs of a product or system, beyond just the initial purchase price. In cloud, it includes operational costs, maintenance, staffing, etc.
    * **OpEx (Operational Expenditure):**
        * **Definition:** Ongoing costs for running a business or system, typically expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Cloud computing often shifts costs from CapEx to OpEx.
    * **CapEx (Capital Expenditure):**
        * **Definition:** Funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment. In traditional IT, large upfront investments in hardware.
